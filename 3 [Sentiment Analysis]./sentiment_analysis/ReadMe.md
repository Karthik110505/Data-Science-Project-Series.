This projects main aim is to clasisfy the input text as positive or negative statements. 

I built an application using Flask, along with the help of the model built in python notebook and stored in pickle file,
which ask the user to input a text and it will  output whether the given text is positive or negative


Inputing text: ![INput](https://github.com/Karthik110505/Data-Science-Project-Series./assets/140957865/141106c2-f138-48ed-af49-e224bedc2f50)
