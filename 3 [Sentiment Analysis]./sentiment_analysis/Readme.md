• This project’s main aim is to classify the input text as positive or negative statements.

• Built an application using Flask, along with the help of the model built in Python notebook and stored in a pickle file,
which asks the user to input a text and outputs whether the given text is positive or negative.

• Implemented machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM. Performed feature extraction, model
evaluation, and built pipelines, tokenizing.
